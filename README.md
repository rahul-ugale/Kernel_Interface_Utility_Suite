# Kernel Interface Utility Suite

**Technology:** C Programming, Linux System Programming, Native System Calls

---

## Project Overview

This project is a custom-built Kernel Interface Utility Suite that programmatically implernents major Linux commands using native system calls.

Instead of relying on existing GNU utilities, we developed our own versions of important commands to understand their internal working at the OS level.

All commands are enhanced with additional features for improved user interaction and customization.

The executables are integrated into the system path, replacing default utilities for leaming purposes, and each command is uniquely identified with the postfix letter "x" (e.g.. 1sx.pwdx.cpx).

This project demonstrates deep understanding of 1 inu…

## Native System Call Usage

Instead of using library-level functions, this suite is implemented using low-level system calls such as:

- `open()`
- `read()`
- `write()`
- `close()`
- `stat()`
- `Istat()`
- `mkdir()`
- `unlink()`
- `rmdir()`
- `chmod()`
- `fork()`
- `exec()`
- `wait()`
- `opendir()`
- `readdir()`

This provides complete control over file handling, process creation, and directory traversal.

## Advanced Custom Features

- Improved error handling and descriptive logging  
- Input validation for safer execution  
- Additional flags not available in default commands  
- Modular code structure  
- Standardized argument parsing  
- Robust edge-case handling  

---

## System-Level Integration

- All executables compiled and placed in system path  
- Commands usable directly from terminal  
- Postfix naming convention (X)  
- Executable permissions properly managed  

---

## Architecture Design

- Modular implementation (one command per file)  
- Common utility module for shared functions  
- System call abstraction where required  
- Structured error reporting
